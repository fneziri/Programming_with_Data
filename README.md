# Programming_with_Data

Code for the Programming with Data module coursework, including:

- Creating of a function to generate n number of records (according to a predefined specification for the data)

- Running analytics to search for and plot abnormal results and creating frequency histograms

- Creating a function to search for particular values, comparing different search algorithms and using the best performing algorithm

- Discussing the computational cost/complexity of the solutions

- Testing the scalability of the selected algorithm by measuring running times for different values of n
